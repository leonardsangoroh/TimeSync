# TimeSync

TimeSync is a productivity tool designed to enhance communication among colleagues working remotely or across different time zones. By utilizing the Nylas API for accessing and managing contact information and integrating the Gemini LLM for intelligent decision-making, TimeSync ensures that your messages are sent at the most appropriate and effective times.

## Features
